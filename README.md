### A Little About Me

I'm a CS major at Boise State University and love working with computers.
I built my first computer when I was 11-12 with my dad's help.
I'm a little older (32), so back then it was all molex connectors and SATA hadn't been invented yet!
Since then, I have had a lot of fun upgrading, building, and _rebuilding_ new computers for myself, my friends, and my family.

Feel free to check back here to see some of the project I end up working on in the future!
